"""Derive Home Assistant bus events from the change between two workspace states.

Events are computed from whole chunks rather than single messages: the server sends a switch
between activities as ``SessionEnded`` then ``SessionStarted`` in one chunk, and deriving from the
settled state turns that into one focus change instead of a stop followed by a start.
